Pathogen style bundle of sparkup vim plugin, based on the sparkup V0.2 branch.

Basically I have created my own fork of the sparkup project. In my branch I
added a file: VimBundle.mk, which puts all the right stuff in this repo. To
use this bundle, just do the normal pathogeny stuff:

	git submodule add  bundle/sparkup

Much easier than the craziness of the sparkup module, no?
